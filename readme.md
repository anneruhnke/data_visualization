# PISA analysis
## by Anne


## Dataset

> The Pisa study is an international study that compared education levels in different countries.
This analysis and visualization focus on the results of the Pisa study.

The following variables are analysed.

'PV1MATH', 'PV2MATH', 'PV3MATH', 'PV4MATH', 'PV5MATH', #math results
'PV1READ', 'PV2READ', 'PV3READ', 'PV4READ', 'PV5READ', #reading results
'PV1SCIE', 'PV2SCIE', 'PV3SCIE', 'PV4SCIE', 'PV5SCIE', #science results               
'CNT', #country
'OECD', #oecd country
'ST01Q01', #International Grade
'ST43Q01', #Perceived Control - Can Succeed with Enough Effort
'ST42Q02', #Math Self-Concept - Not Good at Maths
'ST26Q06', #Possessions - Internet
'ST26Q04', #Possessions - computer
'ST19Q01', #Father Current Job Status
'ST17Q01', #Father<Highest Schooling>
'ST15Q01', #Mother Current Job Status
'ST13Q01', #Mother<Highest Schooling>
'ST04Q01'] #gender


## Summary of Findings

Average math results of students in OECD countries are better.
Male students achieve better math results on average.
Students that have access to a computer achieve better average math results.
Students that have internet access achieve better average math results.
The more students disagree with the statement that they are not good at math, the better their average math results are.
The more students agree with the statement that more effort leads to better results, the better their average math results are.
Students which parents achieved ISCED level 3A (second highest education level) achieve the best average math results.
Male students perform slightly better compared to female students independent of education of their parents.
Students which parents are working full-time achieve best average math results.
There is significant variance in the average results in the countries.
Shanghai and Peru are the countries with the best and worst overall pisa results, e.g. in math, reading and science.
Generally, the same trends are visible in both countries, Shanghai and Peru, compared to the analysis with all countries.

E.g. male students perform slightly better.
E.g. if students have access to a computer the results are better.
E.g. if students have access to internet the results are better.
E.g. if self concept is more positive the results of students are better.
E.g. if perceived control is higher the results of students are better.
E.g. education and job status of parents show same trends.

However, the average results of students in Peru is significantly worse.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The average math results per country vary widely. However, there is no clear pattern regarding OECD and Non-OECD countries. While lots of Non-OECD countries don't perform well, the top performers are also Non-OECD countries. Besides that, the variance of the math results is huge in all the countries.

>Students from Shanghai achieved the best math results while students from Peru achieved the worst math results. However, there are similar trends visible. If students have a more positive self concept, e.g. students think that they are good at math, they generally perform better.

>On average students achieved the highest math results when their mothers earned an ISCED level 3A degree. Interestingly, if mothers earned an ISCED level 3B or 3C degree, the average math results slightly decrease. The same trends are visible for male and female students.
